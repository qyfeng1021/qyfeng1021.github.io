        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the face of current intricate and complex international situation, China will continually stick to the path of peaceful developments, adhere to foreign policy of building friendship and partnership with its neighboring countries, work with other countries to promote regional peace and prosperity. Since the beginning of this year, China has been working relentlessly to achieve steady growth while maintaining stability and economic progress through deepened reform and structural adjustment, shoring up market and public expectation about China's future development. China has the ability not only to achieve the expected social and economic development goals for this year, but also possible to realize constant economic development with good condition in the future, providing much more opportunities for South-East Asian countries like Thailand on development.<br>
China-Thailand cooperation has embarked on a fast lane of development. China-Thailand friendship has taken deep roots in the hearts of the two people and saturated into all aspects of people-to-people exchanges. I firmly believe that with closer exchanges between the two countries, the good neighborly friendship between China and Thailand will forge ahead incessantly like Chang Jiang River and Chao Phraya River, and our all-round mutual beneficial cooperation will enjoy a new brighter future.</p>
